In this lab, we practice classification algorithms.

We create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using evaluation metrics.

We will use algorithms such as:

1. Linear Regression
2. KNN
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. SVM

We will evaluate our models using:

1.  Accuracy Score
2.  Jaccard Index
3.  F1-Score
4.  LogLoss
5.  Mean Absolute Error
6.  Mean Squared Error
7.  R2-Score

Finally, we are using our models to generate the report at the end.
